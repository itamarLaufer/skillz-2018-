# skillz-2018-
Modi'in's (2nd place) code in the 2018 skillz competition


the code should be read as follows:
First read the main method of MyBotCompetitive.doTurn. This is the main method that acts out our turn. 
Then from there go to each method MyBotCompetitive uses. 
BotData saves all the data and updates it
Pushings is responsible for... well....
Unit a class that represents the way we operate - dividing our pirates into attacking units.
MapMethods is mostly just useful methods 

That's most of it, but there are also comments and stuff in there to help your brain grasp the pure genius hidden in our code.
And just to clarify : carry-boi means a pirate that carries a capsule, and THICC means a heavy pirate.

HAVE FUN READING!
